  \cventry{Bachelor's Project}
  {\textit{Arbitrary local refinement of gradient meshes}}
  {}
  {}
  {%
    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Research component: devised a new way to split individual cells in gradient meshes, a popular vector graphics primitive.
    \item Development component: used \cvlanguage{C++} to build an interactive gradient mesh editor, allowing users to move and split cells using the above mentioned refinement scheme.
    \item Soon to be published in an academic journal.
