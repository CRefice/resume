	\cvproject{Bachelor's Project: \textit{Arbitrary local refinement of gradient meshes}}
{March 2020 --- July 2020}
{%
  \begin{cvitems}
		\item Research component: devised a new way to split individual cells in gradient meshes, a popular vector graphics primitive.
		\item Development component: used \cvlanguage{C++} to build an interactive gradient mesh editor, allowing users to move and split cells using the above mentioned refinement scheme.
		\item Soon to be published in an academic journal.

\cvproject{Software Developer, \textit{Individual Project for a Professor}} % Organization
{October 2019 --- January 2020} % Date(s)
{
	\begin{cvitems}
		\item Implemented an automated grading system for Computer Graphics programming assignments, which was used by 100+ students in the Spring 2020 edition of the course.
		\item Devised an algorithm to compare student submissions to a reference solution, implemented in \cvlanguage{C++}.
		\item Integrated the system with the University's code submission platform, built with a \cvlanguage{Node.js} server running submitted programs on \cvlanguage{LXC} containers.
		\item Wrote unit and integration tests.

{%
	\begin{cvitems}
	\item Pitched and subsequently led a team of 4 students in developing a web app to share and rate code snippets for learning purposes, building a \cvlanguage{Python} backend with \cvlanguage{Flask} and a \cvlanguage{JavaScript} frontend with \cvlanguage{Vue}.
	\item Personally conducted customer interviews and elicited application requirements.
	\item Deployed project on \cvlanguage{AWS} using \cvlanguage{Docker} containers, storing data in a \cvlanguage{PostgreSQL} database.
