  {Arbitrary local refinement of gradient meshes}
  {March 2020 --- July 2020}
  {}
  {%
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item Research component: devised a new way to split individual cells in gradient meshes, a popular vector graphics primitive.
      \item Development component: built an interactive gradient mesh editor using \cvlanguage{C++} and \cvlanguage{OpenGL}, allowing users to move and split cells using the above mentioned refinement scheme.
      \item Soon to be published in an academic journal.
    \end{cvitems}

  {%
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item Voted best/most interesting real-time rendered scene among 25 entrants for the OpenGL competition organized by the Computer Graphics course at the University of Groningen.
      \item Used \cvlanguage{C++} to implement a small 3D scene rendered with \cvlanguage{OpenGL} using HDR rendering, shadow mapping, and vertex displacement.

  {%
    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Used \cvlanguage{Rust} to implement a physically-based path tracer to produce photorealistic images from a scene description.
      \item Optimized the implementation to take advantage of parallelism as well as acceleration data structures such as KD-Trees.

  {%
    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Developed a GameBoy emulator for Windows using \cvlanguage{C++}, featuring accurate audio/video emulation and remappable controls.
    \item Created a reusable \cvlanguage{WinAPI} abstraction library to implement the program's user interface.
    \item Reverse-engineered CPU and audio functionality from original developer documentation.
